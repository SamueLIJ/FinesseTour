            <h1>Why New Zealand?</h1> 
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li><p>New Zealand is one of the most sought-after destinations in the world. With its snow-capped mountains, ancient glaciers, rolling hills, and copious amounts of wine, it’s a destination unlike all others.
                    It is also the home of adventure. Where would the world of adventure tourism be without the bungy jump? New Zealander AJ Hackett mastered the art and let the world have a go at the Kawarau Bridge Jump, the first commercial bungy jump operation in the world. Oh, and let’s not forget the jet boat, ski plane and Zorb. </p></li>
                <li><p>New Zealand is the home of the real Middle‑earth™ and what a travesty it would be if the rest of the world couldn’t find it. Find your way to New Zealand and you will discover real landscapes, hobbit holes and special effects studios famous for bringing JRR Tolkien’s creations to life.</p></li>    
                <li><p>New Zealand has a very unique culture. Experience the haka, a ceremonial Māori dance made world famous by the All Blacks rugby team as their pre-game ritual. Beyond the public sporting display, New Zealand celebrates its Māori culture in daily life and there are numerous places to experience it.</p></li>

            <p>New Zealand is a relatively compact country, so you can see most of the country's highlights in two weeks. To explore more of the regions and get off the beaten track, you could easily spend three weeks or more exploring.
                Whether you are going for just a weekend, or for a whole month, you can find an itinerary to suit you.</p>
                
            <p>New Zealand has some of the greatest scenic drives in the world. Picture yourself cruising down the West Coast of the South Island, stopping to look at the Pancake Rocks and Franz Josef Glacier. Or, driving from Christchurch to Queenstown via scenic wonders such as Lake Tekapo and Lake Pukaki. Or making your way to the tip of the North Island on the Twin Coast Discovery highway. </p>

                <h3>Live like a local</h3>
                <p>For a real Kiwi experience, stay in a holiday house ('bach' in local slang). Baches are typically small homes tucked away in quiet coastal towns or other scenic spots, with a back-to-basics approach and retro feel.

                    For deeper insight into local culture as well as the cosiness of a real home, you can enjoy the hospitality of farmstay or homestay hosts.</p>
